Random Binary Search Tree

# Random-Binary-Search-Tree
All test cases are given in Test function
you just need to run the code
If you want to test by your own, then you may creat an object where you call the class Treap()
Now call insert(key) function to generate randomize BST, a parameter you have to provide (key) it must be integer
After inserting different keys through insert() function
you may delete any inserted key by calling delete() function, parameter should be one any key that you inserted otherwise exception rises
you may find any key with its priority which will generate randomely by calling the function find_kth(), you have to give parameter any of inserted key,otherwise exception rises
After inserting,deleting different keys
If you want a randomize BST in pre order then you have to call preorder() function without any parameter
If you want a randomize BST in  order then you have to call inorder() function without any parameter
If you want a randomize BST in post order then you have to call postorder() function without any parameter
